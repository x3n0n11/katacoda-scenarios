## Train

<pre>Before we are able to train our bot, first we must copy over the contents of our .JSON file. This is the file that you have been working on, and one that has information from which the bot will learn.</pre>

<pre>You can see an empty .JSON on your right. Just double click it to bring it up.</pre>

<pre>After you are done copying over the contents, CTRL + S to save your file, andddd you are rady to train your very own chatbot!</pre>

<pre>You can train it by clicking the text below</pre>
