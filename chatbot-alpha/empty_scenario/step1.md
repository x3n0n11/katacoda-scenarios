## Set up environment

<pre>Let's repeat some of those steps that you saw earlier. Same as before, you can just follow along by clicking the text in black boxes :) 
First, we download the code. </pre>

`git clone https://github.com/x3n0n11/nobel_chatbot.git`{{execute}}

<pre> Then, we enter the folder.</pre>

`cd nobel_chatbot`{{execute}}

<pre>And finally, we install those requirements. It's going to take some time :)</pre>

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`{{execute}}
