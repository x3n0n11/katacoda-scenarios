<pre>This scenario contains a very simple Chatbot. You can interact with it, and ask it some simple questions. But before we get chatty, lets make sure everything is set up correctly. </pre>

## Set up environment

<pre>Lets first get all of the code. Click on text bellow, and you can see the command running on the right, in the terminal.
Don't worry if you don't understand what the commands do - but if you are interested I left some cool videos for you in the LMS that will tell you more :) </pre>

`git clone https://github.com/x3n0n11/katacoda_chatbot.git`{{execute}}

<pre>Enter the folder ...</pre>
`cd katacoda_chatbot`{{execute}}

<pre>Install some requirements ... Just be patient, this might take a few </pre>
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`{{execute}}
